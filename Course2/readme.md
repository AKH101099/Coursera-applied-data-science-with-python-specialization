Result of Assignment 2 is represented in the form of plot, where temperature range for 2005 - 2014 year is is filled with gray color. Temperature range for 2005 - 2014 year is plotted on the x axis with the length equal to 1 year. Extreme temperatures for 2015 are represented in the form of blue and red dots.
