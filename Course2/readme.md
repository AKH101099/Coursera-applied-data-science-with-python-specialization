# Course 2
Current folder contains 2nd course of the Coursera specialization named Applied Data Science with Python.

## Assignment 1
There is no assignment 1 :)

## Assignment 2
Aim of the assignment 2 is to show extreme temperature points taken from the [following](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course2/_map.html) loactions:

Result of Assignment 2 is represented in the form of plot, where temperature range for 2005 - 2014 year is is filled with gray color. Temperature range for 2005 - 2014 year is plotted on the x axis with the length equal to 1 year. Extreme temperatures for 2015 are represented in the form of blue and red dots.

You can find the whole assignment 2 [here](https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course2/Assignment2.ipynb)

## Assignment 2.5
Aim of the assignment 2.5 or practical asssignment is to apply [multiple subplots](https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course2/Assignment2_5%20animated%20subplots.ipynb) and [animation](https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course2/Assignment2_5%20Aanimation%20test.mp4) in the matplotlib

## Assignment 3
Aim of the [assignment 3](https://github.com/sersavn/Applied-Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/Course2/Assignment%203.ipynb) is to deal with the confidence intervals while the errorbars are overlapping each other. You can imagine that Y axis is related to the mean number of votes in different areas (real errorplot for votes would be much lower, that is why you need to imagine) X axis is year. Colorbar on the right is showing probablity that the amount of votes will be lower (or higher) and deals with uncertainty.
